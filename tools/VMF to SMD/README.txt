Instructions: 
Extract Zip in to any folder you want, then run the program.

VMF to SMD (V2.0.2) is a rather simple program, which can convert Valve Map Files or 
(older) MAP files to reference Studio Model Data files, for use with Valve's Studio Model 
Compiler.

This tool is aimed mainly at mappers, who want to create large-scale surrounding models 
for their maps. It is also aimed at modellers, who want to start off from a simple, 
Hammer-generated map-scale model, and carry on with the details from there. I also 
understand that many find map editors much easier to work with than model editors. 
However, anyone who has use for this application should by all means use it.

* --Support for Generic Map files--
  Supports the Generic Map format (used mainly in Goldsource map editors). Note that 
  options will change depending on which filetype is opened.

* --Choose unwanted materials/textures--
    Choose the materials/textures you wish the converter to disregard, meaning that all 
    faces with that material/texture will not be converted to triangles.

* --Convert material/texture alignment info--
  Choose whether or not to convert the material/texture alignment information. If 
  selected, it is necessary that you choose a Materials/Textures Folder, because the 
  dimensions of the materials/textures used are required for converting between the two 
  types (UV vectors & shifts to UV coordinates).

  * --Material/texture folder--
    Select the folder from which to read the materials/textures which aren't selected in 
    the skip list. The materials/textures may be in the filesystem as separate .VMT and 
    .VTF files (or .BMP files for MAPs), or in compressed VPK or GCF files (or WAD files 
    for MAPs).

  * --Copy materials/textures--
    Copy the materials/textures found to the specified folder, with their new names (for 
    VMFs, only .VMT files will be copied, as you can modify those to refer to the original 
    .VTF files or create new ones).

    NOTE: This only copies the base file(s) for the material - so materials with more than 
          a single base .VTF referenced in the .VMT will not be fully copied.

* --Remove material sub-folders--
  Eliminates the sub-folders in VMF material names (as valve models do not permit them).

  * --Rename materials with same names--
    Renames materials with the same file names, to avoid conflict when in the same folder.

* --Calc Error--
  In the event of non-material/texture related errors, try increasing this value. I advise
  a value between 0.01 and 0.00001. Lower values improve the precision of the 
  calculations, higher values allow for larger error in the map's plane data. If the map 
  contains only plane vertices with integer coordinates, I advise this to be set close to 
  its maximum value for the lowest chance of error. If you still receive errors, try 
  removing the most complicated and/or large objects from the map.

*-NOTES: -
 TO READ GCF/VPK/WAD FILES: The given HLLib.dll must be in the same folder as the program.

 FOR THE CONVERSION TO WORK: UV vectors in the VMF or MAP CANNOT BE PARALLEL or 0 (the map
 compiler would also error if this were the case).

*-ALSO: -
 If any conversion errors are encountered, they will be put in a log file, which you will 
 have access to at the end. Error boxes that come up after the program has started may be 
 caused only by bad programming on my part - if any appear, please email them to me!

Version History:
-Version 2.0.2
  Fixed a bug where non-english systems would not correctly read floats from VMF files.

-Version 2.0.1
  Fixed a bug where the program would not read material/texture files from filesystem.

-Version 2.0.0
  Added options for VMF material names.
  Moved all basic conversion errors to a log file, with a notification & link at the end.
  Added support for reading materials/textures from GCF, VPK and WAD files (HLLib v2.4.3).
  Improved (and compacted) GUI (+ updated icon).
  Streamlined material/texture alignment conversion code.
  General code cleanup.

-Version 1.1.0
  Fixed several bugs (most potent being a bug with reading the .VMT files).
  Made dev/ materials automatically select in the list after reading .VMFs.
  Made conversions faster by improving the conversion methods involved.
  Added options to skip texture alignment info and to change the calculation error.

-Version 1.0.0
  Initial release.

This allows you to convert Valve Map Files (VMF) and Generic MAPs (MAP) to Studio Model
Data (SMD) files. I suggest you read the above, or alternatively the page regarding this 
program on the Valve Developer wiki (http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VMF_to_SMD) 
before using this program or for help on any problems, before contacting me at the site
